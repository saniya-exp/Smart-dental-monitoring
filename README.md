Final year IOT project for dental cavity detection using camera and web system

# 🦷 Smart Dental Health Monitoring using IoT

This is our final year academic project aimed at assisting early detection of dental problems using image scanning and web-based analysis.

## 📌 Project Summary

- Used a **USB camera** with **2 servo motors** mounted on cardboard to scan dental images.
- Captured images were scanned using an existing **Android app** from the Play Store.
- Images were uploaded to a custom-built **website** which detects cavities and displays results.
- Focused on basic automation and image-based dental health checking.

## 🧰 Hardware/Components

- USB Camera  
- 2x Servo Motors  
- Cardboard Base Setup  
- Android App (used externally)  
- Optional: Arduino (partial implementation)

⚠️ Note: Some components mentioned in the full paper were not implemented due to time/resource limitations.

## 💻 Software

- Android App (external, used for scanning)
- Simple web interface for image upload and cavity detection

## 📷 Screenshots
